# Themes, Snippets and Colorizers

Custom color and icons themes, snippets and language syntax colorizers bring an editor to life. There are lots of existing TextMate customization files available and VS Code lets you easily package and reuse these. You can directly use `.tmTheme`, `.tmSnippets`, and `.tmLanguage` files in your extensions and share them in the extension [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode). This topic describes how to reuse TextMate files as well as create and share your own themes, snippets and colorizers.

## Adding a new Color Theme

Colors visible in the VS Code user interface fall in two categories:

- Workbench colors used in views and editors, from the Activity Bar to the Status Bar. A complete list of all these colors can be found in the [color reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).
- Syntax highlighting colors used for source code in the editor. The theming of these colors is different as syntax colorization is based on TextMate grammars and TextMate themes.

### Workbench colors

The easiest way to create a new workbench color theme is to start with an existing color theme and customize it:

- Switch to the color theme that you want to modify.
- Open the [settings](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/getstarted/settings.md) and make changes to view and editor colors using the `workbench.colorCustomizations`. Changes are applied live to your VS Code instance and no refreshing or reloading is necessary.
- A complete list of all themable colors can be found in the [color reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

### Syntax highlighting colors

For syntax highlighting colors, there are two approaches. You just simply reference an existing TextMate theme (`.tmTheme` file) from the community, or you can come up with your own theming rules. The easiest way is to start with an existing theme and customize it:

- Switch to the color theme to customize and use the `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` [settings](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/getstarted/settings.md). Changes are applied live to your VS Code instance and no refreshing or reloading is necessary.
- The setting supports a simple mode with a set of common token types such as 'comments', 'strings' and 'numbers' available. If you want to color more than than, you need to use textMate theme rules directly.

### TextMate theme rules

To write TextMate theme rules, you need to know about TextMate grammars and scopes.

`TextMate grammars` consist of a set of regular expression that are used create a syntax tree out of the source code. Each tree node spans a source range and represents a `scope`. Scopes have a name and stand for either code sections (such as functions, blocks, comments) or symbols (for example keywords, numbers, operators).

Here's an example of the scope hierarchy generated for a JavaScript code sample:

    function f1() {

![TextMate Scopes](../images/themes-snippets-colorizers/TM-scopes.png)

Each scope name consists of segments separated by dots. The last segment is the name of the language the symbol belongs to: `entity.name.function.js`.

A good overview of scope names that TextMate grammars typically generate can be found [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html).

The list of scope names active at a given offset are the input for syntax highlighting.

Text Mate themes describe the theming rules used for syntax highlighting. Each rule consists of one or more scope selectors and a set of styles: colors (foreground & background) and font styles (bold, italics and underline).

To evaluate the style of a symbol at a given offset, the scopes at that offset are computed. The theming rules are then processed first to last. The rule's scope selectors are matched against that set of scopes. The rule with the most specific match wins.

Here are some example theming rules. The `scope` property lists the rules scope selectors. The `setting` property describes the styles to apply when the rule wins. The `name` is just used for documentation.

- TextMate themes assign a set of styles to one or more scopes. The styles are the foreground color, the background color and bold, italics and underline. A theme consist of a set of rules. To evaluate the style of a symbol, the rules are processed first to last and each scope selector is matched against to symbols scope and parent scopes. The most specific rule is used for styling the symbol.

- Scope selector support prefix matching and matching against parent scopes

<!-- -->

    {
        "name": "Variables",
        "scope": "variable",
        "settings": {
            "foreground": "#dc3958",
            "fontStyle": "bold underline"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "Functions",
        "scope": [
            "entity.name.function",
            "meta.selector.css entity.name.tag",
            "entity.name.method - source.java"
        ],
        "settings": {
            "foreground": "#8ab1b0",
        }
    }

- `variable` matches all scopes that start with `variable`: `variable.js`, `variable.parameter.java`...
- `meta.selector.css entity.name.tag` matches all scopes that start with `entity.name.tag` and have a parent scope that matches `meta.selector.css`
- `entity.name.method - source.java` matches all scopes that start with `entity.name.method` but are not inside a parent scope that matches `source.java`
- Learn more about scope selectors [here](https://manual.macromates.com/en/scope_selectors).

You can use the **Developer Tools: Inspect TM Scopes** command from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) to inspect the scopes of a token at the cursor and to see which theming rule has been applied.

![inspect scoped](../images/themes-snippets-colorizers/inspect-scopes.png)

## Create a new color theme

- Generate a theme file using the **Generate Color Theme from Current Settings** command from the **Command Palette**
- Use VS Code's [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) extension generator, [yo code](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md), to generated a new theme extension.
- If you customized a theme as described above, select 'Start fresh'.

![yo code theme](../images/themes-snippets-colorizers/yocode-colortheme.png)

- Copy the theme file generated from your settings to the new extension.
- To use a existing TextMate theme, you can tell the extension generator to import a TextMate theme file and package it for use in VS Code. Alternatively, if you have already downloaded the theme, replace the `tokenColors` section with a link to the `.tmTheme` file to use.

<!-- -->

    {
        "type": "dark",
        "colors": {
            "editor.background": "#1e1e1e",
            "editor.foreground": "#d4d4d4",
            "editorIndentGuide.background": "#404040",
            "editorRuler.foreground": "#333333",
            "activityBarBadge.background": "#007acc",
            "sideBarTitle.foreground": "#bbbbbb"
        },
        "tokenColors": "./Diner.tmTheme"
    }

> **Tip:** [ColorSublime](http://colorsublime.com/) has hundreds of existing TextMate themes to choose from. Pick a theme you like and copy the Download link to use in the Yeoman generator or into your extension. It will be in a format like `"http://colorsublime.com/theme/download/(number)"`

## Test a new color theme

To try out the new theme, copy the generated theme folder to a new folder under [your `.vscode/extensions` folder](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md#your-extensions-folder) and restart VS Code.

Open the Color Theme picker theme with **File** &gt; **Preferences** &gt; **Color Theme** and you can see your theme in the dropdown. Arrow up and down to see a live preview of your theme.

![select my theme](../images/themes-snippets-colorizers/mytheme.png)

After making changes to any theme file, it is necessary reload VS Code with `Reload Window`.

## Publishing a Theme to the Extension Marketplace

If you'd like to share your new theme with the community, you can publish it to the [Extension Marketplace](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md). Use the [vsce publishing tool](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md) to package your theme and publish it to the VS Code Marketplace.

> **Tip:** To make it easy for users to find your theme, include the word "theme" in the extension description and set the `Category` to `Theme` in your `package.json`.

We also have recommendations on how to make your extension look great on the VS Code Marketplace, see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#marketplace-presentation-tips).

## Adding a new Icon Theme

You can create your own icon theme from icons (preferably SVG) and from icon fonts. As example, check out the two built-in themes: [Minimal](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-defaults) and [Seti](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-seti).

To begin, create a VS Code extension and add the `iconTheme` contribution point.

    "contributes": {
        "iconThemes": [
            {
                "id": "turtles",
                "label": "Turtles",
                "path": "./fileicons/turtles-icon-theme.json"
            }
        ]
    }

The `id` is the identifier for the icon theme. It is currently only used internally. In the future, it might be used in the settings, so make it unique but also readable. `label` is shown in the icon theme picker drop-down. The `path` points to a file in the extension that defines the icon set. If your icon set name follows the `*icon-theme.json` name scheme, you will get completion support and hovers in VS Code.

### Icon Set File

The icon set file is a JSON file consisting file icon associations and icon definitions.

An icon association maps a file type ('file', 'folder', 'json-file'...) to an icon definition. Icon definitions define where the icon is located: That can be an image file or also glyph in a font.

### Icon definitions

The `iconDefinitions` section contains all definitions. Each definition has an id, which will be used to reference the definition. A definition can be referenced also by more than one file association.

        "iconDefinitions": {
            "_folder_dark": {
                "iconPath": "./images/Folder_16x_inverse.svg"
            }
        }

This icon definition above contains a definition with the identifier `_folder_dark`.

The following properties are supported:

- `iconPath`: When using a svg/png: the path to the image.
- `fontCharacter`: When using a glyph font: The character in the font to use.
- `fontColor`: When using a glyph font: The color to use for the glyph.
- `fontSize`: When using a font: The font size. By default, the size specified in the font specification is used. Should be a relative size (e.g. 150%) to the parent font size.
- `fontId`: When using a font: The id of the font. If not specified, the first font specified in font specification section will be picked.

### File association

Icons can be associated to folders, folder names, files, file extensions, file names and [language ids](../../docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.html#_contributeslanguages).

Additionally each of these associations can be refined for 'light' and 'highContrast' color themes.

Each file association points to an icon definition.

    "file": "_file_dark",
    "folder": "_folder_dark",
    "folderExpanded": "_folder_open_dark",
    "folderNames": {
        ".vscode": "_vscode_folder",
    },
    "fileExtensions": {
        "ini": "_ini_file",
    },
    "fileNames": {
        "win.ini": "_win_ini_file",
    },
    "languageIds": {
        "ini": "_ini_file"
    },
    "light": {
        "folderExpanded": "_folder_open_light",
        "folder": "_folder_light",
        "file": "_file_light",
        "fileExtensions": {
            "ini": "_ini_file_light",
        }
    },
    "highContrast": {
    }

- `file` is the default file icon, shown for all files that don't match any extension, filename or language id. Currently all properties defined by the definition of the file icon will be inherited (only relevant for font glyphs, useful for the fontSize).
- `folder` is the folder icon for collapsed folders, and if `folderExpanded` is not set, also for expanded folders. Icons for specific folder names can be associated using the `folderNames` property. The folder icon is optional. If not set, no icon will be shown for folder.
- `folderExpanded` is the folder icon for expanded folders. The expanded folder icon is optional. If not set, the icon defined for `folder` will be shown.
- `folderNames` associates folder names to icons. The key of the set is the folder name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. Folder name matching is case insensitive.
- `folderNamesExpanded` associates folder names to icons for expanded folder. The key of the set is the folder name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. Folder name matching is case insensitive.
- `languageIds` associates languages to icons. The key in the set is the language id as defined in the [language contribution point](../../docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.html#_contributeslanguages). The language of a file is evaluated based on the file extensions and file names as defined in the language contribution. Note that the 'first line match' of the language contribution is not considered.
- `fileExtensions` associates file extensions to icons. The key in the set is the file extension name. The extension name is a file name segment after a dot (not including the dot). File names with multiple dots such as `lib.d.ts` can match multiple extensions; 'd.ts' and 'ts'. Extensions are compared case insensitive.
- `fileNames` associates file names to icons. The key in the set is the full file name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. File name matching is case insensitive. A 'fileName' match is the strongest match, and the icon associated to the file name will be preferred over an icon of a matching fileExtension and also of a matching language Id.

A file extension match is preferred over a language match, but is weaker than a file name match.

The `light` and the `highContrast` section have the same file association properties as just listed. They allow to override icons for the corresponding themes.

### Font definitions

The 'fonts' section lets you declare any number of glyph fonts that you want to use. You can later reference these font in the icon definitions. The font declared first will be used as the default if an icon definition does not specify a font id.

Copy the font file into your extension and set the path accordingly. It is recommended to use [WOFF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/WOFF) fonts.

- Set 'woff' as the format.
- the weight property values are defined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Values).
- the style property values are defined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-style#Values).
- the size should be relative to the font size where the icon is used. Therefore always use percentage.

<!-- -->

        "fonts": [
            {
                "id": "turtles-font",
                "src": [
                    {
                        "path": "./turtles.woff",
                        "format": "woff"
                    }
                ],
                "weight": "normal",
                "style": "normal",
                "size": "150%"
            }
        ],
        "iconDefinitions": {
            "_file": {
                "fontCharacter": "\\E002",
                "fontColor": "#5f8b3b",
                "fontId": "turtles-font"
            }
        }

---

## Using TextMate Snippets

You can also add TextMate snippets (.tmSnippets) to your VS Code installation using the [yo code](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md) extension generator. The generator has an option `New Code Snippets` which lets you point to a folder containing multiple .tmSnippets files and they will be packaged into a VS Code snippet extension. The generator also supports Sublime snippets (.sublime-snippets).

The final generator output has two files: an extension manifest `package.json` which has metadata to integrate the snippets into VS Code and a `snippets.json` file which includes the snippets converted to the VS Code snippet format.

    .
    ├── snippets                    // VS Code integration
    │   └── snippets.json           // The JSON file w/ the snippets
    └── package.json                // extension's manifest

Copy the generated snippets folder to a new folder under [your `.vscode/extensions` folder](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md#your-extensions-folder) and restart VS Code.

## Sharing Your Snippets in the Marketplace

Once you have created your snippets and tested them out, you can share them with the community.

To do this, you need to create a snippet extension. If you've used the `yo code` extension generator, your snippet extension is ready to be published.

If you want to share user snippets, you'll need to package your snippet json file along with an extension manifest which has the necessary metadata to integrate the snippets into VS Code.

Depending on your platform, your user snippets file is located here:

- **Windows** `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\(language).json`
- **Mac** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`
- **Linux** `$HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets/(language).json`

where `(language).json` depends on the targeted language of the snippets (e.g. `markdown.json` for Markdown snippets). Create a new folder for your extension and copy your snippet file to a `snippets` subdirectory.

Now add an extension manifest package.json file to the extension folder. The snippet extension manifest follows the structure defined in the [Extension Manifest](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md) reference and provides a [`snippets` contribution](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.md#contributessnippets).

Below is an example manifest for Markdown snippets:

    {
        "name": "DM-Markdown",
        "publisher": "mscott",
        "description": "Dunder Mifflin Markdown snippets",
        "version": "0.1.0",
        "engines": { "vscode": "0.10.x" },
        "categories": ["Snippets"],
        "contributes": {
            "snippets": [
                {
                    "language": "markdown",
                    "path": "./snippets/markdown.json"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Note that snippets need to be associated with a `language` identifier. This can be a [language supported](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/languages/overview.md) directly by VS Code or a language provided by an extension. Make sure the `language` identifier is correct.

You then use the [vsce publishing tool](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md) to publish the snippet extension to the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md).

> **Tip:** To make it easy for users to find your snippet, include the word "snippet" in the extension description and set the `Category` to `Snippets` in your `package.json`.

We also have recommendations on how to make your extension look great on the VS Code Marketplace, see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#marketplace-presentation-tips).

## Adding a New Language (Colorizer)

Using the ['code' Yeoman generator](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md), you can create an extension that adds syntax highlighting and bracket matching for a language to your VS Code installation.

Central to language support is a TextMate [language specification](https://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars) file (.tmLanguage) that describes the colorizer rules. The yeoman generator either takes an existing TextMate language specification file or lets you start with a fresh one.

A good place to look for existing TextMate .tmLanguage files is on GitHub. Search for a TextMate bundle for the language you are interested in and then navigate to the `Syntaxes` folder. The 'code' Yeoman generator can import either .tmLanguage or .pList files. When prompted for the URL or file location, pass the raw path to the .tmLanguage file, for example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/textmate/ant.tmbundle/master/Syntaxes/Ant.tmLanguage. Make sure that the path points to the content of the file, not the HTML file showing the content.

The generator will prompt you for other information such a unique name (this should be unique to avoid clashing with other extensions) and the language name, aliases and file extensions. You also have to provide the top level scope name of the grammar. That scope name must match the scope name in the tmLanguage file.

When the generator is finished, open the created folder in Visual Studio Code. Have a look at the generated `<languageid>.configuration.json` file: It contains more language settings such as the tokens used for comments and brackets. Make sure the configurations are accurate.

Here is an example for a language with XML-like brackets:

    {
        "comments": {
            "lineComment": "",
            "blockComment": ["<!--", "-->"]
        },
        "brackets": [
            ["<", ">"]
        ],
        "autoClosingPairs": [
            ["<", ">"],
            ["'", "'"],
            ["\"", "\""]
        ],
        "surroundingPairs": [
            ["<", ">"],
            ["'", "'"],
            ["\"", "\""]
        ]
    }

For more details check out the [languages contribution point documentation](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points.md#contributeslanguages).

The generated `vsc-extension-quickstart.md` file also contains more information on how to run and debug your extension.

To use your extension in your stable VS Code installation, copy the complete output folder to a new folder under [your `.vscode/extensions` folder](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/yocode.md#your-extensions-folder) and restart VS Code. When you restart VS Code, your new language will be visible in the language specifier drop-down and you'll get full colorization and bracket/tag matching for files matching the language's file extension.

## Publishing Language Support to the Extension Marketplace

If you'd like to share your new language with the community, you can publish it to the [Extension Marketplace](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md). Use the [vsce publishing tool](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md) to package your extension and publish it to the VS Code Marketplace.

> **Tip:** To make it easy for users to find your language support, include the language name and words "language" or "language support" in the extension description and set the `Category` to `Languages` in your `package.json`.

We also have recommendations on how to make your extension look great on the VS Code Marketplace, see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#marketplace-presentation-tips).

## Add to your Language Support Extension

When you're adding a new language to VS Code, it is also great to add language [snippets](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets.md) to support common editing actions. It is easy to [combine multiple extensions](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#combining-extension-contributions) like snippets and colorizers into the same extension. You can modify the colorizer extension manifest `package.json` to include a `snippets` contribution and the snippets.json.

    {
        "name": "language-latex",
        "description": "LaTeX Language Support",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "publisher": "someone",
        "engines": {
            "vscode": "0.10.x"
        },
        "categories": [
            "Languages",
            "Snippets"
        ],
        "contributes": {
            "languages": [{
                "id": "latex",
                "aliases": ["LaTeX", "latex"],
                "extensions": [".tex"]
            }],
            "grammars": [{
                "language": "latex",
                "scopeName": "text.tex.latex",
                "path": "./syntaxes/latex.tmLanguage"
            }],
            "snippets": [
                {
                    "language": "latex",
                    "path": "./snippets/snippets.json"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

## Language Identifiers

In VS Code, each language mode has a unique specific language identifier. That identifier is rarely seen by the user except in the settings, e.g. when associating file extensions to a language:

        "files.associations": {
            "*.myphp": "php"
        }

Note that casing matters for exact identifier matching ('Markdown' != 'markdown')

The language identifier becomes essential for VS Code extension developers when adding new language capabilities or when replacing a language support.

Every language defines its _id_ through the `languages` configuration point:

        "languages": [{
            "id": "java",
            "extensions": [ ".java", ".jav" ],
            "aliases": [ "Java", "java" ]
        }]

Language supports are added using the language identifier:

        "grammars": [{
            "language": "groovy",
            "scopeName": "source.groovy",
            "path": "./syntaxes/Groovy.tmLanguage"
        }],
        "snippets": [{
            "language": "groovy",
            "path": "./snippets/groovy.json"
        }]

### New identifier guidelines

When defining a new language identifier, use the following guidelines:

- Use the lowercased programming language name.
- Search for other extensions in the Marketplace to find out if a language identifier has already been used.

You can find a list of known language identifiers in the [language identifier reference](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/languages/identifiers.md).

## Common Questions

**Q: What parts of VS code can I theme with a custom color theme?**

The VS Code color themes affect the editor input area (text foreground, background, selection, lineHighlight, caret, and the syntax tokens) as well as some of the custom UI (see the list in [Creating a Theme](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers.md#creating-a-custom-theme)). When contributing a theme, you also specify a base theme: light (`vs`), dark (`vs-dark`) and high contrast (`hc-black`). The base theme is used for all other areas in the workbench such as the File Explorer. Base themes are not customizable or contributable by extensions.

**Q: Is there a list of scopes that I can use in my custom color theme?**

VS Code themes are standard TextMate themes and the tokenizers used in VS code are well established TextMate tokenizers, mostly maintained by the community and in use in other products.

To learn about what scopes are used where, check out the [TextMate documentation](https://manual.macromates.com/en/themes) and this useful [blog post](https://www.apeth.com/nonblog/stories/textmatebundle.html). A great place to examine themes is [here](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/).

**Q: I created a snippets extension but they aren't showing up in the VS Code editor?**

**A:** Be sure you have correctly specified the `language` identifier for your snippet (e.g. `markdown` for Markdown .md files, `plaintext` for Plain Text .txt files). Also verify that the relative path to the snippets json file is correct.

**Q: Can I add more file extensions to my colorizer?**

**A:** Yes, the `yo code` generator provides the default file extensions from the .tmLanguage file but you can easily add more file extensions to a `languages` contribution `extensions` array. In the example below, the `.asp` file extension has been added to the default `.asa` file extension.

    {
        "name": "asp",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "engines": {
            "vscode": "0.10.x"
        },
        "publisher": "none",
        "contributes": {
            "languages": [{
                "id": "asp",
                "aliases": ["ASP", "asp"],
                "extensions": [".asa", ".asp"]
            }],
            "grammars": [{
                "language": "asp",
                "scopeName": "source.asp",
                "path": "./syntaxes/asp.tmLanguage"
            }]
        }
    }

**Q: Can I add more file extensions to an existing colorizer?**

**A:** Yes. To extend an existing colorizer, you can associate a file extension to an existing language identifier with the `files.associations` [setting](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/docs/getstarted/settings.md). IntelliSense will show you the list of currently available language ids.

For example, the setting below adds the `.mmd` file extension to the `markdown` colorizer:

        "files.associations": {
            "*.mmd": "markdown"
        }

**Q: What if I want to completely override an existing colorizer?**

**A:** Yes. You override the colorizer by providing a new `grammars` element for an existing language id. Also, add a `extensionDependencies` attribute that contains the name of the extension that defines the grammar that you want to replace.

    {
        "name": "override-xml",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "engines": {
            "vscode": "0.10.x"
        },
        "publisher": "none",
        "extensionDependencies": [
            "xml"
        ],
        "contributes": {
            "grammars": [{
                "language": "xml",
                "scopeName": "text.xml",
                "path": "./syntaxes/BetterXML.tmLanguage"
            }]
        }
    }
